# Contributing to Frontman

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Frontman! This guide will help you get set up and productive quickly.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before your first contribution can be merged, you must sign our [Contributor License Agreement](./CLA.md). This is required for all contributors — individual and corporate.

**Why a CLA?** Frontman uses a dual-licensing model. The server (`apps/frontman_server/`) is open source under the [AGPL-3.0](./apps/frontman_server/LICENSE), and we also offer a [commercial license](./COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md) for enterprise customers. The CLA ensures we can continue to offer both licensing options while protecting contributors' rights.

**How it works:** When you submit your first pull request, the CLA Assistant bot will post a comment asking you to sign. You sign via GitHub OAuth — it takes about 30 seconds. Your signature covers all future contributions.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v24+
- **Yarn 4** (via [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html): `corepack enable`)
- **Elixir** 1.19+ (only needed for the server in `apps/frontman_server/`)
- **mkcert** (for local SSL certificates)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/frontman-ai/frontman.git
cd frontman

# Install dependencies
make install

# Build all packages
make build

# Start the dev environment
make dev
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Branch from `main`** — Create a feature branch for your change.
2. **Use `make` commands** — The task runner is Makefiles, not yarn/npm scripts. Run `make help` in any directory to see available targets.
3. **Run tests** — Run `make test` in the relevant `libs/` directory before submitting a PR.
4. **Add a changeset** — If your change is user-facing, run `yarn changeset` from the repo root and follow the prompts. A CI check will block PRs that are missing a changeset.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Language | [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) |
| Backend | [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) / [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) |
| UI | [React](https://react.dev/) |
| Runtime | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) |

## Code Conventions

### ReScript

- Functional style with `Result` types for error handling.
- **Crash early and obviously.** Use `Option.getOrThrow` / `Result.getOrThrow` when a value should always exist. Never silently swallow exceptions.
- File naming follows the `Client__ComponentName.res` flat-folder convention.
- JSON parsing: always use [Sury](https://github.com/sury-lib/sury) schemas (`@schema` annotation) instead of manual `Dict.get` chains.
- State management: all API calls and side effects go through the `StateReducer` (see `libs/client/`).

### Tests

- Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with `rescript-vitest`.
- Test files are named `*.test.res.mjs`.
- Assertion style: `t->expect(value)->Expect.toEqual(expected)`.

Run the packed `@frontman-ai/astro` consumer against a supported Astro version with:

```bash
make -C test/astro-compat ASTRO_VERSION=7
```

Use `5`, `6`, or `7` to test another supported major. This installs the packed package with strict peer dependency validation before building and testing the fixture.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the PR template (description, related issues, testing checklist).
2. Ensure CI passes — linting, type checking, and tests are run automatically.
3. A maintainer will review your PR. We aim to provide initial feedback within a few business days.

## Fork Releases

This fork does not deploy applications. Its daily upstream sync creates a
same-version GitHub Release and publishes a multi-architecture image to
`ghcr.io/lkshrk/frontman-oidc`.

## License

Frontman uses a dual-licensing model:

- **Client libraries** (`libs/`): [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE) — permissive, suitable for embedding in your applications
- **Server** (`apps/frontman_server/`): [AGPL-3.0](./apps/frontman_server/LICENSE) — copyleft, with [AI supplementary terms](./AI-SUPPLEMENTARY-TERMS.md)
- **Commercial use**: A [commercial license](./COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md) is available for organizations that need different terms

By submitting a contribution, you agree to the terms of the [Contributor License Agreement](./CLA.md).
